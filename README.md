# LevelUpLboro
Welcome to my coursework submission for 25COA122: a games booking system created using Python, ipywidgets and matplotlib. The project is split into teach of the following functionalities:
- **Database Validation**: Consisting of 4 functions used to ensure that all processes are allowed in the system, whether this be: validating a customer's subscription; checking a game's availability; checking if a customer has reached their rental limit;and ensuring that no booked sessions go above the 50-person in-store limit,
- **Find a Game**: Performs a search of either board or video games in the stores inventory, displaying it's stored information,
- **Rent a Game**: An extension of the findGame display, allows customers to rent games provided that they aren't currently being rented out elsewhere (the assumption is made that only one copy of each game is owned),
- **Return a Game**: Allows customers to return games and give related feedback alongside a numerical rating,
- **Book a Session**: Allows customers to book either an afternoon or evening session on a given day, provided their chosen session isn't full,
- **Inventory Management**: Shows how many rentals occur at different times in the year, allowing management to identify booms and when marketing is needed more. Also displays the genre-split of voices, with the relevant function also returning the average rating of each genre though displaying this on-hover is a future implememtation.

In order to run the project, click the 'Run all' button at the top of the screen, upload the files found in the same folder as this menu and scroll to the 'Main Program' section at the bottom of the notebook to see the GUI and interact with the above functions. Enjoy using LevelUpLboro!
